- Back Stack: https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack
	- Every new activity/screen loaded gets pushed to the back stack
	- Pressing the back button removes/pops the last activity and user returns to the prior one
- Task: https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack
	- Represents a collection of screens or activities that belong together and form a back stack together
	- Multiple tasks can be running at once (going from browser screen to an Instagram screen)
- Launch Modes: https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack#ManifestForTasks
	- Allows you to set the behavior when a new activity gets pushed on the back stack
	- Standard
		- Default mode
		- Typical usage
	- Single Top
		- Does not add another activity to the back stack in certain cases
		- Pretty commonly useful
	- Single Task
		- New activities are launched in a completely separate task
		- Example: Opening a link in Instagram and it launches a website using an in-app browser window instead of sending you to browser app separately
	- Single Instance
		- New activity launched is completely isolated inside the same task so it does not interfere with the existing back stack
		- Example: Payment activity in a PayPal app is launched in Single Instance mode by another app
		- Not very common, used for specific situations
